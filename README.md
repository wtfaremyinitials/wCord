wCord
=====

A fork of [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord) with support for
animated MOTDs.

Currently included in this fork is [MylesCord](https://github.com/MylesIsCool/MylesCord)'s
animated MOTD feature, which has been rolled back. I will be keeping this fork up
to date with BungeeCord, and continue to support animated MOTD.
